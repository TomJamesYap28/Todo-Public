The project involves the development of a streamlined employee dashboard, designed to enhance task management and productivity. The system features distinct access levels, with an admin page for creating employee profiles and assigning specific to-do lists, and an employee page for logging tasks and updating their status. The dashboard is further enhanced with integrated tools such as a calendar, graphical data representations, and a Daily Time Record (DTR) system, ensuring a comprehensive solution for task and time management.
